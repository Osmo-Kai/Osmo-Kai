## 🚀 About Me
Hi, I’m **Osmo** 👋  
I’m a Full Stack Developer who enjoys turning ideas into functional and beautiful digital solutions. I work across the stack—from building responsive frontends to designing robust backends and APIs.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:  
🎸 Jamming on my guitar or 🎹 playing my keyboard  
🌴 Exploring nature, traveling, or going on adventure trips  
📚 Reading books and learning new things  
🧩 Solving problems (because nothing feels better than cracking a tough one!)  

I love challenges, continuous learning, and creating solutions that make an impact.
